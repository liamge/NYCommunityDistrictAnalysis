# NYCommunityDistrictAnalysis
Dashboard/Analysis of public NYC Community District data

PDFs of annual Community District needs parsed using Tesseract, then had autosummarization run on them using BART model and then had RoBERTa QA model run on it to generate extracted information of the most pressing needs of each community.  

Tweets about each Community District scraped using Snscrape and then had SOTA Sentiment Analysis run using Flair.
